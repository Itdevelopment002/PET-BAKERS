        <p>Welcome to Furry Frostings!</p>
        <p>
          At Furry Frostings, we’re passionate about two things: pets and
          delicious treats. Founded by Vivek Bhutani and co-founder Anshu
          Bhutani, we are devoted pet lovers and avid bakers. Our bakery is
          where the magic happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every treat that leaves our kitchen is made with love, care, and the
          finest ingredients, ensuring that your furry friends get the tastiest
          and healthiest snacks possible. Whether it's a crunchy biscuit, a
          savory snack, or a decadent cake for a special occasion, we’ve got
          your pet’s cravings covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it’s not just about the treats. It’s about the joy on your pet's
          face when they indulge in our creations. It’s about the wag of their
          tail, the purr of contentment, and the unconditional love they give us
          every day. That's why we pour our hearts into every batch we bake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join our growing family of satisfied pet parents and treat your furry
          companions to something truly special. Because at Furry Frostings, we
          believe every pet deserves a little extra love and attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for choosing Furry Frostings – where every treat is a
          tail-wagging delight!
